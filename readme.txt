Code structure: bnet takes 1 to 6(no more, no fewer) command line arguments. First, there are one to five arguments, each argument specifying a variable among Burglary, Earthquake, Alarm, JohnCalls, and MaryCalls and a value equal to true or false. Then, we evaluate the input and then we create the truth table specifying each of the variables. We then call the function calculateProbability that computes the probability of any combination of events given any other combination of events.
